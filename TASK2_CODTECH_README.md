## DESCRIPTION

The REST API Client Application is a sophisticated Java program that demonstrates modern web service integration by consuming public REST APIs and processing JSON responses. This project showcases advanced HTTP client programming, JSON parsing, and structured data presentation techniques using Java 11's built-in HttpClient API.

**Core Functionality:**

**1. HTTP Client Implementation:**
The application utilizes Java 11's HttpClient for making secure HTTP GET requests to the JSONPlaceholder public API. It implements proper timeout configurations, connection management, and request header handling to ensure reliable network communication.

**2. JSON Response Processing:**
Develops custom JSON parsing algorithms without external dependencies, demonstrating pure Java string manipulation and data extraction techniques. The system efficiently parses nested JSON objects and arrays to extract meaningful user information.

**3. Structured Data Display:**
Transforms raw JSON data into user-friendly, formatted output with clear categorization of user information, address details, and company data. Implements professional console output formatting for enhanced readability.

**4. Error Handling and Fallback Systems:**
Incorporates comprehensive error handling for network failures, API timeouts, and JSON parsing errors. Includes fallback demo data functionality to ensure application reliability even when external APIs are unavailable.

**5. Network Configuration Management:**
Handles various network scenarios including proxy configurations, firewall restrictions, and connection timeouts. Implements retry mechanisms and graceful degradation for robust network communication.

**Technical Architecture:**
The application follows modern Java development practices using HttpClient, HttpRequest, and HttpResponse classes from the java.net.http package. Custom JSON parsing methods utilize string manipulation algorithms for data extraction, demonstrating algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.

**API Integration Details:**
Connects to JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1) to fetch user data including personal information, address details, and company information. Processes nested JSON structures to extract and display comprehensive user profiles.

**Advanced Features:**
- Configurable timeout settings for network requests
- Custom JSON parsing without external libraries
- Nested object extraction for complex data structures
- Professional error reporting and logging
- Cross-platform network compatibility

**Challenges Addressed:**
- Implemented robust network error handling for unreliable connections
- Developed efficient JSON parsing algorithms for nested data structures
- Created fallback mechanisms for offline functionality
- Optimized memory usage for large JSON responses
- Ensured cross-platform compatibility for different operating systems

**Real-World Applications:**
This project demonstrates skills essential for modern enterprise applications including microservices integration, API gateway development, data aggregation services, and third-party service integration platforms.

The implementation showcases professional software development practices including proper error handling, resource management, and user experience considerations crucial for production-level applications.
